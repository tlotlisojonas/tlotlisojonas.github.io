            <h3>Student Intern: Dual Arm Scara Robot</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXbmovPoU"><p class="uppercase">UCT ROBOTICS AND AGENTS RESEARCH LAB</p></a>
            <p>26 November 2018 - 11 February 2019</p>
            <p>The project was divided into two parts and the first part was to investigate comparison between the use of pneumatic cylinders, air muscles, and geared electric motors as actuators to be used to accurately position the end effector attached to the robot arm(s) in a cartesian co-ordinate frame. Finally I built version 1 of the dual arm scara robot.</p>
            <p>The second part of the project was in a form of team work where I worked with the other three Engineering students (Electromechanical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering) to built an educational manufacturing cell prototype. I was working with an Electromechanical Engineering student to built a sub system (version 2 of the Dual arm scara robot) of the manufacturing cell, this was about improving the version 1 of the dual arm scara robot. The Electrical engineering student built a conveyor and the Mechanical Engineering student built a gripper for the end effector of the robot arm. All the sub systems were then integrated together to make a functional unit.</p>
