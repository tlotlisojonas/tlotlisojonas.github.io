                  <p>The first pillar is the "Connect event", here Promaths senior students formally welcome all Promaths alumni into the UCT society and get to know each other because we are from different Promaths chapters. We also provide a space where our members get to have lot of fun by playing different games and activities. Most importantly from this event we set long term goal of educating society members about what the purpose and aim of the society.</p>

We usually invite invite relevant motivational speakers to this event, people who have been on the same path so that it is easy to relate and this usually spark a very strong motivation.</p>

          <h1>About US</h1>
          <p>Promaths is a powerful partnership between Investec and Kutlwanong Maths, Science and Technology Centre. The programme provides extra tuition in Maths and Science to high school learners who show potential in these subjects. Promaths first began in Dobsonville, Soweto over 13 years ago. UCT Promaths alumni is the support structure for promaths alumni students who are studying at UCT. In this society UCT Promaths senior students welcome high school students and help them to quickly adapt to UCT with the experience they have as senior students. Each and every year we have four main events where society members get together to celebrate our four pillars.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Executive Committee</h3>
          <p>Like every other family, a family needs parents. Our execuive committee is made of 10 members as shown on the left hand side. Our executive committee serves as the parents to our family, they ensure that all society  activies happen according to plan. Our society also has other small supporting structures such as "Mento-mentees" program and "Promaths cares". Mento-mentee program is where our senior members sign up to be mentors to our junior members and provide them with mentorship througout the year. Promaths cares is a program that we initiated to assist our members with their basic needs such as stationary and toiletries, we usually encourage people to donate anything that can be needed by the other person. As Promaths executive we usually arrange some regular meetings throughout the year just to catch up and constantly support one another.</p>
